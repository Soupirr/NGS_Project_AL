Antibiotic resistance genes were identified using ResFinder. Four acquired resistance determinants were detected, including aac(6')-Ii and msr(C) located on the chromosome, and dfrG and VanHAX located on plasmids. The presence of the VanHAX cluster, conferring resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin, highlights the clinically relevant multidrug-resistant profile of the strain and suggests a role for horizontal gene transfer.
