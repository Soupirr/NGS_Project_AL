# Antibiotic resistance analysis

This directory contains the results of antibiotic resistance gene detection.

---

## Tool used

### ResFinder
ResFinder was used to identify acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in the assembled genome.

Antibiotic resistance genes were identified using ResFinder. Four acquired resistance determinants were detected, including aac(6')-Ii and msr(C) located on the chromosome, and dfrG and VanHAX located on plasmids. The presence of the VanHAX cluster, conferring resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin, highlights the clinically relevant multidrug-resistant profile of the strain and suggests a role for horizontal gene transfer.

## Input
- Assembled genome sequence (FASTA)

---

## Outputs included
- Tabulated results listing detected resistance genes and associated antibiotic classes

## Notes
This analysis provides complementary functional insight into the resistance potential of the strain and supports the genomic characterization.
