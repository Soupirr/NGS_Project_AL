# Genome assembly evaluation

This directory contains the evaluation of the genome assembly generated from PacBio long reads.

The goal of this step is to assess the quality, continuity and completeness of the assembled genome before downstream analyses.

## Assembly evaluated
- Assembly type: PacBio long-read assembly
- Expected genome size: ~2.8 Mb (Enterococcus faecium)

---

## Tools used

### QUAST
QUAST was used to compute standard assembly metrics:
- Number of contigs = 7
- Total assembly length = 3168410
- Largest contig = 2765010
- N50 = 1
- L50 = 2765010
- GC content = 37.7

QUAST provides a global overview of the structural quality of the assembly.

### BUSCO
BUSCO was used to evaluate genome completeness using:
- Lineage dataset: `firmicutes_odb10`

BUSCO assesses the presence of conserved single-copy orthologs expected in Firmicutes genomes, providing an estimation of completeness and potential duplication.

Our result shows that 99,5% of the genome is complete with only 1 fragmented BUSCO and 4 duplicate.

## Outputs included in the repository
- QUAST summary reports (HTML and TXT)
- BUSCO short summary files (TXT and JSON)

## Notes
Large intermediate files generated by BUSCO and QUAST (temporary files, predicted genes, alignment outputs) are not versioned to keep the repository lightweight. All results can be regenerated using the provided scripts.
